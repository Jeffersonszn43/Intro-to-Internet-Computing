## Intro to Internet Computing Projects
#### Here is a repository of the web applications I created for the Internet Computing course. I created five different projects from the course, which were:

### 1. Online Resume: 

- The first project I created was an online resume that featured my actual resume. The webpage was a simple outline of my resume.

### 2. Online Resume Using Bootstrap:

- The second project involved taking our first online resume that didn't feature any styling and modify it using a Bootstrap template of our choice. 

### 3. Mathematical Calculator: 

- The purpose behind the third project was to create a mathematical calculator using a bootstrap template that will calculate the max, min, mean, median, and range of three numbers that the user is supposed to enter. The results of thses calculations would be shown on the screen when the user clicks on calculate.

### 4. Tic-Tac-Toe Game:

- The fourth project involved creating a tic-tac-toe game using a bootstrap template that will be played by two players. Players will have the ability to restart the game at anytime they wish during their match. Once a winner is determined, a toastr alert will let the player know (X or O), that they won the game.

### 5. Project Portal:

- The fifth project involved creating a portal using a bootstrap template that showcases all of the projects created from the course. Once the user clicks on view project, they will get redirected to the web application of that project.
