                <figcaption><strong>RGB Lab</strong>: This project is designed to have a user choose a color on a color wheel and have an arrow on the wheel turn to that color. The project also displays the color the user enters vibrantly with LEDs and displays a number to the user corresponding to the color the user enters. Python was used to create the software for the project. Here is a link to my GitHub page that shows a repository of this project: <a href="https://github.com/Jeffersonszn43/RGB-Project.git">RGB Project</a>.</figcaption>
